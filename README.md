# Becoming the new Martin Garrix; Where do you start?

What started as a creative and musical video game kickstarted multiple musical revolutions. FruityLoops’
attractive, simple and colourful interface opened the product up for a larger audience. Its power was that it
did not rely on difficult terminology and experience but it focused on new and curious creatives that didn’t
even consider making music before. This simplicity allowed the sharing of knowledge tricks and
techniques which fueled the FL user base to become a thriving community.

Producers posted their project files on forums, requesting feedback and looking for tips and techniques.
This was also the case for famous producers such as Avicii and Martin Garrix. Later they shared their
production knowledge and skills through videos on YouTube. Some of these videos have scored millions
of views, for example ‘Martin Garrix In The Studio With Future Music' which totaled 9.5 million views since
it was uploaded 7 years ago.

However this community does not exist of only the big names within the electronic dance music (EDM)
industry. Hundreds of individuals share their knowledge and skills through tutorial videos on YouTube
each month while the famous artists only share a tutorial sporadically, mainly as a collaboration with a
music platform or magazine such as DJ Mag. Nonetheless, these tutorials by well-known artists include
premium software, so called plug-ins, that cost tens to thousands of dollars.

A Pakistani study on the impact of YouTube tutorials by M. Iftikhar (2019) found that YouTube tutorials
have a positive impact for skill development on youth. However, this study only focused on software
learning for academic purposes. However, it did not cover creative software such as FL Studio.
Additionally, the study by M. Iftikhar did not make a distinction between the variables that distinguish
videos. Therefore, the dataset in our study will allow researchers to perform studies on video attributes
within the creative segment of Youtube.
